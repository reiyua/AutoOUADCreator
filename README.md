# AutoOUADCreator

Simple Microsoft PowerShell script I had to make as part of my General Diploma in I.T at TAFE NSW that batch creates OU's within an existing Active Directory Domain Forest.

I was initially going to create one script which not only does this but ALSO creates user's with the OU's but found it was not possible to do so.

An example CSV file has been provided for reference.
